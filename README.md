## Story 📖

While I was at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), folks there bought and set up an arcade cabinet ([RCade](https://rcade.recurse.com)) where anyone could publish their game onto via GitHub.

The arcade had a controls for two players, each getting:
- a joystick
- two buttons
- a spinner

So I first thought of making a tank game, since that could involve all the controls: joystick for tank movement, spinner for turret movement, etc.

This became the intial commit on the main branch of this repo:

Then I thought: Why did I think of a violent game? I should turn this game into something less violent. So I turned tank into a [farm-like game](https://github.com/holistudio/project-tank/tree/farm), where grid cells "grow" into green cells over time:

Then I made player 1's tank shoot out water while player 2's tank plants seeds, turning the competitive game into a [cooperative game](https://github.com/holistudio/project-tank/tree/seed-water-farm):

This is the current state of the game for now. It has also been ported to an [RCade version](https://github.com/holistudio/tank-farm), displayed on a smaller screen:

And it's now live at RCade :)

It's fair to say that 100% of the code was vibecoded with Gemini - but 100% of the ideas came from me.

This was done so that I could learn how to port a game to the RCade system rather than spend time making a game from scratch. (And it turned out that even when I tried vibe-coding the port to a smaller RCade screen, Gemini ended up creating a few bugs that I had to fix anyway. So all in all, a real coding experience of understanding someone else's code and debugging it)
